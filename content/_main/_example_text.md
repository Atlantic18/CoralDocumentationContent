Unlike the CMS systems Coral gives you the freedom of choice. You can either use the default Controllers which map the Coral content to URLs. Or you can keep your controller and add Coral features.

Coral gives you the ease of composing a page of multiple content sources without a single line of code. And also the possibility to add the same features to your existing codebase.
